# CNN-BrainTumorDetection

## Description
Experimental Deep Learning Brain Tumor MRI Detection and Classification Project. This is work in progress.
Uses Image Pre-processing to hightlight features. Train and test 3 types (VGG14, InceptionV3, ResNet50) of
Convolutional Neural Network Architectures and asess accuracy metrics of each type.
New Section will apply CSPNet (Cross Stage Partial Networks, Jun-Wei Hsieh et. al.) to same Brain Tumor
Data.
